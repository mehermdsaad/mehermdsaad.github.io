And yes, they took to the fight stones and bricks against bullets and gunpowder. The rest is history from start till the end- a month of intense one-sided fights- with shields of flesh against sharp bullets the people fought and dethroned the most vile dictator the nation has had to face.\nNo, I am not mentioning this to reminisce about historical events. My purpose rather is to look inside myself as I deal with the world. If I am able to gain a better look into myself by analyzing past events and how I might have dealt with them, I may hope to prepare myself better for the events to come. (However this brings up another discussion altogether, why does it concern me so much to improve my stance on the world? Is it because I too want to have an impact? Is it really impact that I crave?)\nWould I have made a stand with a brick in my hands in front of guns? Or would I run away? Somewhere in my head there’s this voice that says my life is too important to lose- I ask myself would it have gone to waste if I died in July? What about an unnamed martyr of July who got killed and not even his comrades know his name. Then I think of Shahid Hadi, and I know his life was successful as he was loved by the entire country at his death. But what if he died for the same cause and no one knew his name? Would he still have been successful in my eyes? I know the answer is yes, but then it’s not an effortless conclusion in my head. Is it becuase I value human validation more? Or maybe it’s because I am thinking in terms of impact. Yes, the martyrdom of Shahid Hadi had a huge impact, whereas that unnamed martyr of July, who died somewhere in some street without anyone even knowing who he is- he must have had no impact right? His forgotten sacrifice is, well, forgotten. Was it then worth it for him?\nImpact vs Intent First of all the assumption that an unnamed forgotten martyr had no impact is not particularly correct. Yes, some martyrdom had more impact in this world than others. Abu Sayeed’s death may have had more impact than an unnamed fighter. But then does it negate the impact of the latter? I think of the battle of Yarmuk, or even any battles muslims fought. We tend to remember their glorious victories, but underneath that victory lies thousands of muslims who fought and was killed. For someone who died at the very first instant of the battle, say during the first exchange of the arrows- and had no contribution to the fight except maybe taking someone else’s arrow- does it make his sacrifice less worthy? Or let’s use the word- does it make it less impactful? In a worldly view, I think you could say so. One could however argue that his intention was to have an impact and he did show up for the cause. But then who cares about intention without impact in this world? I so far haven’t found a good worldly explanation of why someone would make his position in the first ranks of the battle field- maybe there just aren’t any.\nWhen you look at things without faith in the afterlife and in the greatest reward, it almost doesn’t make sense to do what you know is right. I know it’s praiseworthy to fight in the first ranks of the battle field, even though the chance of me falling in the battle might be higher. So then what benefit is it to me for me to potentially give up my life?\nBut if you change the context, things start to make better sense. What if your intentions are part of the metric, and not the impact alone? What if the unnamed individual who was killed without anyone knowing got recognition from the Highest Authority? What if he receives a far better life than what he could have ever lived in this world as reward for his actions? If so, then it does make complete sense to chase the first ranks. It does make sense to die for a cause you believe in- because you aren’t just losing, you are being compensated, in the next life. You know you are loved by the One Who created you, and you are struggling out of love for Him. Because to love truth and justice is to love the One Who is the truth, the Most Just. And to give your life loving Him, is there a better way to meet Him other than such?\nA Happy Ending If there’s a second July, would I jump to the first ranks? “But I need to live longer” I can hear a voice inside me. “Why else did I go abroad and study so hard? I must make sure I earn a living, establish my family and take care of them.” I always seem to have a plan ahead of myself. I have an idea of where I will be in my life in the near future, maybe doing higher studies or jobs in the future, providing for my family. I should get to live longer right? But say I die tomorrow, a natural death. Would death wait for me to finalize my plan? Also, why should I get to live longer, if say my fellow brothers go out and fight? I get this feeling that I have to live out to see the end of the story. I should live to see the day when the world’s oppression is ended, and truth is winning- and I’ll get to have a happy ending.\nBut what about the fighter who got killed on day 1? What about his story- is that a happy ending? What about Abrar, who was beaten to death for speaking out against Indian hegemony? If my end was such, would I consider that a happy ending? Does everyone have to have a happy ending? What if it was me who was killed instead of Abrar? That can happen anytime in the future. Why then do I feel so entitled to a happy ending?\nLife, as we live it is lived from our own perspective. As we are born, we quickly learn that our thoughts are not shared with others and so we start living as if we are the main characters of the story. And in some sense we are. But it’s the expectations that come along with this thought that are contrary to the events of life. Whenever we hear of negative outcomes, we never expect them to happen to us. We being the main characters of the story must get a happy ending where it will work out in the end. But maybe it doesn’t have to.\nMaybe the real story is far beyond our individual lives, maybe we are the NPCs in this huge story of humanity.\n",
