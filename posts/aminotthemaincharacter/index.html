Then I think of Shahid Hadi, and I know his life was successful as he was loved by the entire country at his death. But what if he died for the same cause and no one knew his name? Would he still have been successful in my eyes? I know the answer is yes, but then it’s not an effortless conclusion in my head. Is it becuase I value human validation more? Or maybe it’s because I am thinking in terms of impact. Yes, the martyrdom of Shahid Hadi had a huge impact, whereas that unnamed martyr of July, who died somewhere in some street without anyone even knowing who he is- he must have had no impact right?

Yes, some martyrdom had more impact in this world than others. Abu Sayeed’s death may have had more impact than an unnamed fighter. But then does it negate the impact of the latter? I think of the battle of Yarmuk, or even any battles muslims fought. We tend to remember their glorious victories, but underneath that victory lies thousands of muslims who fought and was killed. For someone who died at the very first instant of the battle, say during the first exchange of the arrows- and had no contribution to the fight except maybe taking someone else’s arrow- does it make his sacrifice less worthy? Or let’s use the word- does it make it less impactful? In a worldly view, I think you could say so. You could say his intention was to have an impact and he did show up for the cause.

I know it’s praiseworthy to fight in the first ranks of the battle field, even though the chance of me falling might be higher.
