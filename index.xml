      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think of the events of July quite often. When people rose up to the streets with stones against bullets. To an uninformed audience this might sound almost poetic and thus crafted; however this is indeed what happened on the ground in the year 2024 in Bangladesh. As the police along with Chatro League started raining fire over the students and general people, the people didn&amp;rsquo;t disperse- they swelled even more. And yes, they took to the fight stones and bricks against bullets and gunpowder. The rest is history from start till the end- a month of intense one-sided fights- with shields of flesh against sharp bullets the people fought and dethroned the most vile dictator the nation has seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
